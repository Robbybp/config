When connecting to a gitlab instance for the first time, we get the
message "unable to verify authenticity of host". To verify authenticity,
find the host's SSH fingerprint at the following page:
```
gitlab.example/help/instance_configuration
```
Here, `gitlab.example` is the domain of the partigular gitlab instance.
